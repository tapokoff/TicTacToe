# Tic Tac Toe
The project was created as an example of working with UIKit and autolayout. 
The project is implemented as a single page application with controls, labels and a playing field represented as a UIImageView and nine buttons on it.
The interface is fully adaptive and works correctly on all Apple mobile phones.

>Game control - the player must click on the place on the game field where he wants to put a cross or a circle, after which the required image will appear in the selected cell. After pressing the "Play Again" button, the playing field is cleared and the game starts again
